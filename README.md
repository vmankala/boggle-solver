## Boggle Solver
A Boggle solver created using React. Utilizes evergreen-ui for styling.

This tool can help you win Boggle games. Type out the letters of your Boggle board and submit them to generate all possible words that can be created with that letter arrangement.

Answers are generated using a depth first search. The algorithm is made more efficient by leveraging a trie (prefix tree) to find valid word prefixes.
